				About the Legend
			</h1>
			<p>
				☛Narendra Damodardas Modi; <b>(born 17 September 1950)</b>
                 is an Indian politician who has served as the 
                 <b>14th prime minister of India since May 2014</b>. 
                 Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 
                 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi..<br><br>
				☛ He is a member of the <b>Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 
                and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)</b>,
                 a right wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation.
                  He is the longest-serving prime minister from 
                  outside the Indian National Congress.<br><br>
				☛ Modi was born and raised in <b>Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat</b>, 
                where he completed his secondary education. 
                <b>He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight</b>.
                 His account of helping his father sell tea at the 
                 Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably corroborated.
                 At age 18, he was married to <b>Jashodaben Modi</b>, whom he abandoned soon after,
                 only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so.
                 Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. 
                The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions 
                within the party hierarchy until 2001,
                 rising to the rank of general secretary.
                <br><br>
				☛ In <b>2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat</b> 
                and elected to the legislative assembly soon after.
                 His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,
                 and has been criticised for its management of the crisis.
                 A little over <b>1,000 people</b> were killed, according to official records,
                 three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim. 
                 A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012
                 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him. 
                While his policies as chief minister, which were credited for encouraging economic growth, were praised,
                 Modi's administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.
                
				<br><br> ☛ In the <b>2014 Indian general election,
                Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority</b>, the first for a party since 1984.
                His administration increased direct foreign investment, and it reduced
                spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes.
                Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated the
                2016 demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and introduced the
                Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.
               <strong>
					“Modi-ji.”</strong>
				<br><br> ☛ Modi's administration launched the <b>2019 Balakot airstrike
                against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan</b>.
                The airstrike failed, and the deaths of six Indian personnel
                to friendly fire was later revealed: but the action had nationalist appeal. 
               Modi's party won the 2019 general election which followed. 
               In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir,
                an Indian-administered portion of the disputed Kashmir region, 
               and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests,
                and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs, 
               sometimes with the complicity of police forces controlled by the Modi administration. 
               Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal.               
				<br><br> ☛  Modi oversaw <b>India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                during which 4.7 million out of 1.4 billion Indians died</b>, 
                according to the World Health Organization's estimates.
				<br><br> ☛ Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced <b>democratic backsliding, 
                or the weakening of democratic institutions, individual rights, 
                and freedom of expression</b>. As prime minister, 
                he has received consistently high approval ratings                
				<br><br> ☛ Modi has been described as <b>engineering a political realignment towards
                right-wing politics</b>. He remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally, 
               over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the Gujarat riots, 
               which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.               
				<br><br> ☛ As chief minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government,
                which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, 
               which is usually described as <b>anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation</b>.
                Modi's policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in Gujarat. 
               He established financial and technology parks in the state and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit,
                real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion 
                <b>(equivalent to ₹20 trillion or US$250 billion in 2023)</b> were signed.
				<br><br> ☛ HINDUTVA:
                The activities of a number of <b>Hindu nationalist organisations increased
                in scope after Modi's appointment as prime minister</b>, sometimes with the government's support.
                These activities included a Hindu religious conversion programme, 
               a campaign against the supposed Islamic practice of "Love Jihad" and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse,
                the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right-wing organisation Hindu Mahasabha. 
               Government officials, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion programmes.               
				<br><br> ☛ ECONOMY:
                The Modi government's economic policies focused on <b>privatisation and
                liberalisation of the economy</b>,
                and were based on a neoliberal framework. 
               Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, 
               allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including defence and railways.
               Other proposed reforms included making the forming of unions more difficult for workers,
                and making recruitment and dismissal easier for employers; 
               some of these proposals were abandoned after protests. 
               The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on <b>2 September 2015</b>, 
               eleven of the country's largest unions—including one affiliated with the BJP—struck.
                <b>The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (Indian Workers Union), a constituent of the Sangh Parivar (Family of the RSS),
                stated the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers</b>.               
				<br><br> ☛ FORIEGN POLICY:
                Foreign policy played a <b>small role in Modi's election campaign and 
                did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto</b>. Modi's foreign policy, 
                similarly to that of the preceding Congress government, focused on improving economic ties,
                security and regional relations.] Modi continued Manmohan Singh's policy of "multi-alignment”. 
                The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources,
                especially East Asia, with the use of slogans such as <b>"Make in India" and "Digital India"</b>. 
                The government also tried to improve relations with <b>Islamic nations in the Middle East,

				<br><br> ☛ SECURITY:
                India's nominal military spending steadily increased under Modi.

                and when adjusted for inflation. A substantial portion of the 
                military budget was devoted to personnel costs commentators wrote the
                 budget was constraining Indian military modernisation.
